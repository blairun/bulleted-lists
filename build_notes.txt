- Bulleted-lists
   + Bug: enter on/in/after multi line carries over some characters
   + Auto capitalize after moving between rows with arrow keys
   - Add setting for auto capitalization
   - Backspace after "- " should remove two characters
   - try using onDidChangeCursorPosition rather looking for it with arrow keys and enter/home
   - Feature: backspace deletes whole bullet if it is the only character on line
   - Feature: choose bullet type with ctrl-1, ctrl-2, ctrl-3, like OneNote
   - Feature: switch between symbol groups like MS Word: -~+, O0#, ! !! !!!, 123, *, ...
   - Update through git rather than atom during development
   - Git config http.sslVerify false, Git init, git pull <repository>
   - Limit bulleted lists to plain text
   - Git and github integration? how does it work and is it duplicating/or being overridden by git+?
